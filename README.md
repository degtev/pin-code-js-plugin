## Introduction

The Pin Code Plugin is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides an easy and intuitive way to manage pin code input fields. It allows users to enter a pin code across multiple input fields and handles input restrictions, navigation, and event callbacks.

This plugin can be used to enhance the pin code input experience in various applications, such as login forms, authentication systems, and secure transactions.

## Features

- Accepts pin code input across multiple input fields
- Restricts input to numeric characters only
- Handles navigation between input fields automatically
- Supports pasting of a complete pin code
- Customizable event callbacks for input handling

## Installation

To use the Pin Code Plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the `pin-code-plugin.js` file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/degtev/pin-code-js-plugin).
2. Include the `pin-code-plugin.js` file in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/pin-code-plugin.js"></script>
   ```

3. Add the required HTML structure for the pin code input fields:

   ```html
   <div id="pinCodeContainer">
     <input type="text" maxlength="1" />
     <input type="text" maxlength="1" />
     <input type="text" maxlength="1" />
     <input type="text" maxlength="1" />
   </div>
   ```

   Make sure to set the `maxlength` attribute to the desired length of your pin code.

4. Initialize the plugin with the container element:

   ```javascript
   PinCodePlugin.init("#pinCodeContainer");
   ```

## Usage

To use the Pin Code Plugin, follow these steps:

1. Create a container element that will hold the pin code input fields.
2. Inside the container, add individual input fields to represent each digit of the pin code. Set the `maxlength` attribute on each input field to specify the length of the pin code.
3. Initialize the plugin by calling the `init()` method and passing the selector for the container element as an argument.
4. Customize the plugin behavior and appearance by modifying the provided methods and CSS styles.

## Methods

The Pin Code Plugin provides the following methods:

- `init(selector)`: Initializes the plugin by finding the pin code container element and registering event handlers.

## Events

The Pin Code Plugin triggers the following events:

- `input`: Fired when an input field value changes.
- `paste`: Fired when text is pasted into the container element.
- `keydown`: Fired when a key is pressed down inside an input field.
